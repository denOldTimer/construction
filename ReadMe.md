Widepack - backend - Php-Mvc using webpack as scss -> css compiler.

Remark: Got to run webpack twice:
    - 1 so that the files: images and fonts can be copied to the rightfull place 
        in the public folder.
    - 2 so that webpack module can do it's thing mainly converting and bundling
        into two separate files: bundle.js && bundle.css.
